<h4>Statistics of weight loss</h4>
<p>The AR game's potential for weight loss was a big part of that discussion. In the process of getting out their doors and visiting parks, players found they were losing weight almost in spite of themselves. A Reddit Pokémon Go fan won acclaim for reporting that he'd lost 65 pounds between July and December.</p>

    </div>
     <p class='ch'>&quot;Greninja is the final evolution of Pokémon X and Y water-type starter Froakie. It has the ability to take on an appearance resembling its trainer. Pokedex says: Greninja creates throwing stars out of compressed water. When it spins them and throws them at high speed, these stars can split metal in two.&quot;</p>

        <p class="ch">&quot;Mimikyu caused quite a stir for its peculiar looks and sad backstory when it was originally announced for Pokémon Sun and Moon in 2016. Mimikyu is described as a Pokémon who felt so lonely that it decided to wear a rag in order to look like Pikachu, everyone’s favorite Pokémon. Pokedex says: Its actual appearance is unknown.

  <h2>Q and A</h2>
<h3>Questions Every Pokemon Trainer Should Be Able To Answer</h3>
<ol>
  <li>What Pokemon does Pikachu evolve into?</li>
  <li><ul>
    <li>We're sure you know this Electric mouse Pokemon, and you know it quite well. Basic knowledge of Pikachu is essential for every trainer, but you should also be well versed in the rodent's evolutionary chain. Pikachu, mighty as it is, has an even stronger evolved form also capable of generating vast amounts of electricity. Maybe you've bumped into this species in the wild. Either way, this is a question all Pokemon trainers should be able to answer.</li>
    <li>Answer is Raichu</li>
  </ul></li>
</ol>
<ol>
  <li>What's the most effective Poke Ball in the game?</li>
  <li><ul>
    <li>Not all Poke Balls are made equally. There's the basic model you start your journey off with, but progressive upgrades are needed if you're looking to keep up with some of the stronger wild Pokemon who emerge in later routes. If you've made your way through any Pokemon game, you've reached the point where you're presented with the most effective Poke Ball known to man. This is a one shot catch, and no button mashing at all is required. </li>
    <li>Answer is Master Ball</li>
  </ul></li>

<h5>Type chart, effectiveness and weakness explained in Pokémon Go</h5>

<p>Pokémon battles appear in most forms of Pokémon media, being the central gameplay aspect of the core series games, as well as being a constant focus of the anime.</p>
<p>Pokémon Go's Types are exactly the same as those in the main Pokémon games, but the effect of those type matchups is slightly different: in brief, things like effective or resisted attacks have slightly different multipliers to the main Pokémon games - although a December 2018 update brought them slightly closer in line.</p>
